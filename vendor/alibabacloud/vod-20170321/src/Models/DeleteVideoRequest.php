     *
     *   If the video is uploaded by using the [ApsaraVideo VOD console](https://vod.console.aliyun.com), log on to the console and choose **Media Files** > **Audio/Video** to view the ID of the video.
     *   If the video is uploaded by calling the [CreateUploadVideo](~~55407~~) operation, the video ID is the VideoId value in the response.
     *   You can also call the [SearchMedia](~~86044~~) operation to obtain the video ID, which is the VideoId value in the response.
     *
     * @example e44ebf1147hdsa2d2adbea8b****,e44ebf11oj984adbea8****,73ab850b4f6f4b6e91d24d81d54****
